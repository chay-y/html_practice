        <h2 id="what">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2> 
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <br>
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <br><br><br>

        <h2 id="why">Why do we use it?</h2>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <br>
        content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is <br>
        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <br>
        'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop <br>
        publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default <br>
        model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in <br>
        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br>
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

        <br><br><br>

        <h2 id="where">Where does it come from?</h2>
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in <br>
        a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br>
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up <br>
        one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going <br>
        through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br>
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum <br>
        " (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise <br>
        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <br>
        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
